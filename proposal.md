# Compiler Project – Initial Definition

## 1. Student Information
- **Name:**
- **Program:**
- **Course:** Compiler Design
- **Semester / Year:** Spring 2026

## 2. Project Overview
This project will develop a C code compiler, with an initial implementation in C.
My particular interests include simultaneous instruction multiple data registers.
After basic implementation I would like to incorporate both loop unrolling and SIMD optimizations.

## 3. Source Language
C

## 4. Target / Output Language
I would like the output of the compiler to be directly in assembly so that I can more readily confirm the register utilization.

## 5. Compiler Features (Planned)
List the features you plan to implement. For example:
- Lexical analysis
- Syntax analysis (parser type, if known)
- Semantic analysis
- Intermediate representation
- Optimizations (if any)
- Code generation

## 6. Tools and Libraries
List any tools, frameworks, or libraries you plan to use:
- Parser generators (e.g., ANTLR, Bison, Yacc)
- Build tools
- Testing frameworks

## 7. Repository Information
- **Repository hosting service:**  
  (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- **Repository URL:**  
  (Public or private is acceptable)

## 8. Project Status
- [ ] Repository created
- [ ] README file added
- [ ] Initial project structure committed

## 9. Additional Notes
Any additional comments, assumptions, or ideas related to the project.
