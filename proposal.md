# Compiler Project – Initial Definition

## 1. Student Information
- **Name:**
- **Program:**
- **Course:** Compiler Design
- **Semester / Year:**

## 2. Project Overview
Provide a brief description of your compiler project (1–2 paragraphs).  
What problem does it solve? What kind of language are you designing or compiling?
Include the Programming language you will use to implement the compiler (e.g., C, C++, Java, Python, Rust, etc.)

- Lexical analysis
- Syntax analysis (parser type, if known)
- Semantic analysis
- Intermediate representation
- Optimizations (if any)
- Code generation

## 6. Tools and Libraries
List any tools, frameworks, or libraries you plan to use:
- Parser generators (e.g., ANTLR, Bison, Yacc)
- Build tools
- Testing frameworks

## 7. Repository Information
